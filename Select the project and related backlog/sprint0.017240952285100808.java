Spring Boot Application:
The Spring Boot application will consist of a controller class, a service class, and a repository class.
Controller Class: 
The controller class will accept the user's input and pass it to the service class. It will also handle the response from the service class and return the response to the user.
Service Class: 
The service class will process the user's input and call the JIRA API to retrieve the user stories associated with the selected project and user stories. It will also receive the response from the JIRA API and pass it to the repository class.
Repository Class:
The repository class will store the user stories retrieved from the JIRA API. It will also be responsible for retrieving the user stories when requested by the service class.
